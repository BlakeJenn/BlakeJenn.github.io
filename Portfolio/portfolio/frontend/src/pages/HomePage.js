            <h3>My Career</h3>
            <p>
                For my career, I eventually want to work with AI in the healthcare field. I originally wanted
                to be a doctor when I started college, and eventually music won over. Now that I am working
                towards a degree in computer science, I am learning more and more about Machine Learning and its
                benefits in healthcare. I would love to get a job after this degree that will help me get
                a masters in machine learning and make my career path a full circle from when I was 18.
